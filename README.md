## Project
### Description
This repository hosts the code for our CSC 3520 - Machine Learning final project. The purpose of this project is to take data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) titled ["Top Hits Spotify from 2000-2019"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019) and train various machine learning models to predict song popularity on Spotify.
### Models
At this time, none of the models have been trained and we are not completely sure at this time if the proposed models will ultimately be the ones that we train.
#### Decision Tree
#### Neural Network
#### Support Vector Machine
